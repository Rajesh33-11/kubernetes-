# How many ways can we create a Pod in Kubernetes?

👉 There are mainly 2 ways to create a Pod.


## 1️⃣ Imperative way (Direct CLI command)

✔ Creates through Commands


## 2️⃣ Declarative way (Using YAML file) 

✔ Creates through files (Mainfest files)

---
## To create a Pod
```
kubectl run pod_name --image=image_name
```
For example: pod_name= raja, image_name=shammu101/dm
```
kubectl run raja --image=shammu101/dm
```

```
kubectl api-resources | grep pod
```

# Create a pod using manifest files
```
vim pod.yaml
```
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod3
spec:
  containers:
    - name: cont1
      image: shammu101/cycle
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
### apiVersion: v1
👉 Tells Kubernetes which API version to use for creating this resource.

### kind: Pod
👉 Specifies that we are creating a Pod resource.

### metadata:
👉 Contains identifying information about the Pod.

### name: mypod3
👉 Assigns the name mypod3 to the Pod.

### spec:
👉 Defines the desired configuration (specification) of the Pod.

###  containers:
👉 Lists the containers that will run inside this Pod.

### - name: cont1
👉 Sets the name of the container as cont1.

###   image: shammu101/cycle
👉 Specifies the Docker image to pull and run for this container.

###    ports:
👉 Declares which ports the container will expose.

### - containerPort: 80
👉 Exposes port 80 inside the container for application access.
# rum yaml file
```
kubectl create -f pod.yaml

# To access a Pod, we need to create a Service file.
## Services are 3 Types
### 1) NodePort
👉 NodePort exposes the application on a fixed port of each worker node, allowing external access using NodeIP:NodePort.
### 2) ClusterIP
👉 ClusterIP exposes the application only within the Kubernetes cluster using an internal IP, and it cannot be accessed from outside.
### 3) LoadBalancer
👉 LoadBalancer exposes the application to the internet by automatically creating a cloud provider’s load balancer and assigning a public IP.
